    <h2>The Questions</h2>
    <h3>Frequently asked, and otherwise</h3>
</header>
<div class="content">
    <h4>When are Ellen and Barney getting married?</h4>
    <p>At long last.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, on Sunday 18th December, 2016.</p>

    <h4>Where is the wedding venue?</h4>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.leez-priory.co.uk">Leez Priory</a>, Hartford End, Great Leighs, Chelmsford, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Leez+Priory+Wedding+Venue/@51.839514,0.467375,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x75c2ac1393672bf!8m2!3d51.839514!4d0.467375" target="_blank">CM3 1JP</a></p>
    <p>Since you asked, it's a 16th-century mansion in the parish of Little Leighs, Chelmsford, Essex.</p>

    <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
    <p>We would suggest that walking should be avoided; not only because it puts a strain
      on the knees, but also vehicular transportation can be much more comfortable in cold weather.
    </p>
    <p>If you have access to a car, and are able to drive it, there is ample parking at the venue.
      However, there are a number of reputable firms which when given the promise of payment at
      the end of a journey, will provide you with both a vehicle and someone to drive it for you.
      Sadly, you will either have to dismiss the driver after the conclusion of your journey, or pay them to wait patiently
      outside, because we are regretfully unable to provide accommodation or refreshment to anyone
      who is technically the paid staff of our guests, however temporary.</p>
      <p>It is also true that while there is, unfortunately, no heli-pad or landing strip on the grounds, there
        are a number of excellent fields nearby, whose bovine inhabitants would only be too delighted
        to witness your arrival by helicopter or light aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>Disapparation is strictly forbidden, on the grounds that it doesn't exist, and you
        should be old enough by now to realise this.</p>

      <h4>What time should I arrive?</h4>
      <p>Depending on how precise you wish to be upon arrival, you could either arrive at the beginning
        of the 21st Century and wait a few years, or simply arrive between midday and 12:45 on the 18th December, 2016.
</p>
<p>We have exclusive use of the venue from 12, when welcome drinks will be available.
  The ceremony is at 1pm sharp; if you are late, you may miss the ceremony, but more
  importantly, you will miss the welcome drinks.</p>

  <h4>What is the itinerary for the day?</h4>
    <p>That would spoil the surprise.</p>
    <p>We can tell you that it includes speeches, food, fizzy wine, a disco and possibly
      some white doves, depending on how clean they are.</p>

      <h4>What time should evening guests arrive?</h4>
      <p>The evening's festivities begin at 6pm, with disco, an amazing feast of a platter, a bar and the
        universe generally going foom.</p>

  <h4>What time will we get kicked out?</h4>
  <p>This entirely depends on how long your trousers stay on.</p>
  <p>Assuming that you remain fully clothed and don't try and mount any statues,
    carriages are either at midnight, or earlier if you drink so much you're sick.</p>

  <h4>Can I bring my children?</h4>
  <p>This would be much less weird than bringing someone else's children.</p>
  <p>As parents ourselves, we appreciate that it can be difficult to arrange
    childcare, so we are able to accomodate children on the day. Please let
    us know in advance how many you're bringing, and their ages, as this
    information is required by the venue, and the inevitable security firms
    we'll need to keep an eye on them.</p>

  <h4>Can I bring my pets?</h4>
  <p>No.</p>

  <h4>How about confetti?</h4>
  <p>Petals that float on the breeze: yes.</p>
  <p>Damp paper that sticks to your shoes: no.</p>
  <p>Rice: double no.</p>

  <h4>Do you have a gift list?</h4>
  <p>In the four years we've been together, we have accumilated
    two cars, four games consoles, innumerable Apple&trade; devices
    a baby, two copies of 'Cards Against Humanity', 24 pairs of shoes,
    two cats, three Swiss Army Knives and SO MUCH MORE.</p>
    <p>Your company is gift enough.</p>

  <h4>Are you having a honeymoon?</h4>
  <p>When we can afford one, and when Oscar starts sleeping through
    the night.</p>

  <h4>Know of any good hotels in Chelmsford?</h4>
  <p>Well, there are actually a limited number of bedrooms
    available at the venue, including a slap-up breakfast
    the following morning.  Please contact us directly to check
    prices and availability.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, we also have details for <a href="#accomodation">local hotels and B&amp;Bs</a>.</p>
